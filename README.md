# Text-To-Speech-Converter-App
In the Project, the Text To Speech Converter App 
and knew how
I made it using HTML CSS & Vanilla JavaScript.
No external JavaScript libraries or APIs are used to make this TTS App and I hope you have liked this project.

In the JavaScript code, first, 
I got the user text and call a function textToSpeech() with passing user text as an argument. 
Inside this function, using the speech synthesis property of the window object, 
I converted the entered text to speech. 
Speech Synthesis is a web speech API that controls the speech service.

After this, 
I got all available voices from the user device using the 
getVoices() method of Speech Synthesis and insert it into HTML select tag. 
Thatâ€™s all and I request you to watch the full video where 
I have explained each JavaScript line with a written comment so you can understand the codes more easily.
